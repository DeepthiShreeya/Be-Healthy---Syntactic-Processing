## General Information
- This project performs syntactic processing on textual data from the BeHealthy dataset, aiming to analyze sentence structure and extract key linguistic features.
- The primary objective is to enhance the understanding of language patterns through tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, and syntactic parsing.
- The processed data can be leveraged for various downstream NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, chatbot development, and healthcare text analytics.

## Conclusions
- The implemented syntactic processing pipeline effectively extracts grammatical components, enabling deeper insights into text structure.
- Key achievements include accurate tokenization, robust part-of-speech tagging, and reliable parsing of sentence syntax.
- These insights lay the groundwork for improved language understanding in applications that require nuanced text analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **NLTK** – Natural Language Toolkit for text processing tasks
- **SpaCy** – Advanced NLP library for syntactic parsing and entity recognition
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization for analysis of linguistic features

## Acknowledgements
